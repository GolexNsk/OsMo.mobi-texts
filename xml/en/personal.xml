  <gtk3>The maximum number of points per session ~200 000, then the session is forcibly terminated by the system</gtk3>
  <gtk4>If not authorized, the device does not send coordinates within 12 hours, session monitoring is automatically closed</gtk4>
  <gtk5>If the account is not received coordinate within 36 hours, the monitoring session is automatically closed.</gtk5>
