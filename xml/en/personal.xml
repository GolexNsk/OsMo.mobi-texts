  <b1t>Easy and simple</b1t>
  <b1d>By installing the application, working with OsMo, share your location easily</b1d>
  
  <b2t>Share it session</b2t>
  <b2d>When you start the transmission of the coordinates generated links of the form https://osmo.mobi/s/**_***_** it works until you stop the session</b2d>
  
  <b3t>Permalink</b3t>
  <b3d>If you need to give the opportunity to have constant access to your location to someone - create a permanent link, it will always show your location while sending coordinates. She works forever, as long as it does not remove.</b3d>

  <gtk0>Every time you start and stop monitoring in our system submitted in a separate trip "session"</gtk0>
  <gtk1>At the same time not one authorized device or one account can have only one running session monitoring</gtk1>
  <gtk2>During the session, within 24 hours after its inception, should be sent at least one coordinate, otherwise it is considered empty and will be removed</gtk2>
  <gtk3>The maximum number of points per session ~200 000, then the session is forcibly terminated by the system</gtk3>
  <gtk4>If not authorized, the device does not send coordinates within 12 hours, session monitoring is automatically closed</gtk4>
  <gtk5>If the account is not received coordinate within 36 hours, the monitoring session is automatically closed.</gtk5>
  <gtk6>If the majority of the points sent in the last 24 hours with zero speed - the session is considered useless, and the device can be locked</gtk6>
  
  <session_ended>The session had already ended</session_ended>
  <session_ended_description>To continue to observe this unit you can ask for a link to a new session, the permanent link or log in with a user in one group</session_ended_description>
