  <gtk0>Every time you start and stop monitoring creates a "trip", which is then stored in history</gtk0>
  <gtk1>At the same time not one authorized device or one account can have only one trip</gtk1>
  <gtk2>Once travel has commenced, within 6 hours, should be sent at least one coordinate, otherwise it is considered empty and will be removed</gtk2>
  <gtk3>The maximum number of the sent coordinates for the trip ~200 000, then it can be forcibly terminated</gtk3>
  <gtk4>If not authorized, the device does not send coordinates within 4 hours, the trip will automatically end</gtk4>
  <gtk5>If the account is not received coordinate within 8 hours, the trip will automatically end</gtk5>
  <gtk6>If the majority of the points sent in the last 24 hours will be with zero speed - the drive is considered useless, and the device can be locked</gtk6>
  
  <session_ended>The trip has already ended</session_ended>
  <session_ended_description>To continue to observe this unit you can ask for a link to a new session, the permanent link or log in with a user in one group</session_ended_description>
